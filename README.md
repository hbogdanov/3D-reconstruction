# 3D-reconstruction
End-to-end 3D scene reconstruction using open-source, calibrated camera–LiDAR datasets. Trains metric-scale neural reconstructions (Gaussian Splatting and NeRF) with pose alignment from odometry, exports geometry to USD, loads scenes into Isaac Sim, and evaluates quality using PSNR and depth RMSE.
